# Scouter

## Description
This is a tool to measure the resource usage of a specific process in the PC environment.

It was developed separately for macOS and Windows.

This is expected to be useful when light performance testing is required, and anyone can use it easily.

Of course, if you're a developer, you might laugh at this. But if you're a Quality Assurance Engineer or a Test Engineer, it might be useful.
